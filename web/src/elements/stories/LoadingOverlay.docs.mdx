# LoadingOverlay

The LoadingOverlay is meant to cover the container element completely, hiding the content behind a
dimming filter, while content loads.

It has a single named slot, "body" into which messages about the loading process can be included.

## Usage

```Typescript
import "@goauthentik/elements/LoadingOverlay.js";
```

Note that the content of an alert _must_ be a valid HTML component; plain text does not work here.

```html
<ak-loading-overlay topMost>
    ><span slot="body">This would display in the "body" slot</span></ak-loading-overlay
>
```

## Demo

### Default

<Story of={LoadingOverlayStories.DefaultStory} />

### With a message

<Story of={LoadingOverlayStories.WithAMessage} />
